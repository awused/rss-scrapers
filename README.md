# Rss Scrapers

A collection of rss scrapers to create rss feeds for sites that do not provide their own feeds.

# Running Locally

They're made to be used with [aw-rss](https://github.com/awused/aw-rss) where they can be used as external commands. Some of them have individual configuration files.

The mangadex scraper will also read the [manga-syncer](https://github.com/awused/manga-syncer) config, if available, to exclude blocked groups.

You should run them from the command line to verify the output.
