# Rss Scrapers

A collection of standalone rss scrapers to create rss feeds for sites that do not provide their own feeds.

# Running Locally

The individual scrapers are go gettable. The best way to use them is with [aw-rss](https://github.com/awused/aw-rss) where they can be used as external commands.

You should run them from the command line to verify the output.
